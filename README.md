##Introduction:

The brain is an extremely complex system, consisting of approximately 100 billion neurons
that are connected to one another. The way these neurons are structured allows for very
efficient and robust function. For example, human face recognition outperforms any currently
available machine algorithm. One way to better understand this complex structure is to
elucidate how it arises during development. The improvements in computing technology in
the last few years have made it possible to use large-scale computer simulations to
investigate such developmental processes. However, the appropriate software that can fully
exploit the potentials of the state-of-the-art hardware remains to be implemented.

A currently available software solution to simulate neural development is Cx3D,
<https://www.ini.uzh.ch/~amw/seco/cx3d/>. However, this software is Java-based, and not
ideal for high-performance computing (HPC). In order to adapt Cx3D to support HPC, a
software that has similar functionalities as Cx3D but is coded in C++ is needed.
