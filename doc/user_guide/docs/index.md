## What is BioDynaMo?

The BioDynaMo project aims at a general platform for computer simulations of
biological tissue dynamics, such as for example brain development. Since these
scientific investigations require extensive computer resources, this platform
should be executable on hybrid cloud computing systems, allowing for the efficient
use of state-of-the-art computing technology.
