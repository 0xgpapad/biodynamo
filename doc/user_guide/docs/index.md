## What is BioDynaMo?

BioDynaMo is a platform through which life scientists
can easily create, run, and visualise three-dimensional
biological simulations. Built on top of the latest computing
technologies, the BioDynaMo platform will enable users to
perform simulations of previously unachievable scale and
complexity, making it possible to tackle challenging scientific
research questions.
